# Phantom's Curse

A Fabric mod for 1.21.4. Changes the behaviour of phantoms using ideas from SimplySarc, from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30BmmdCnc3A)

## Mod Features (incomplete features are unchecked)
- Sleep Irregularity
  - [x] Players who sleep regularly in a familiar bed remain unaffected.
  - [ ] Players who sleep erratically, in temporary or random beds, trigger phantom spawns.
- Phantom Behavior Changes
  - [x] Phantoms only target players with “Sleep Irregularity.”
  - [x] Only affected players can see, attack, and be attacked by these phantoms.
  - [x] If a phantom hits an affected player, they receive the Insomnia status effect, preventing sleep for the night.
- Phantom Combat Mechanics
  - [ ] Mimicry: Matches an elytra-flying player’s speed and movement, diving and gliding similarly. However, phantoms aren’t as agile and can be outmaneuvered using obstacles.
  - [ ] Turbulence: If a player flies too close to a phantom, they get the Turbulence effect for 10 seconds, scrambling and inverting their elytra controls.
  - [ ] Flank Attack: Phantoms attempt to ram into the player from the side while they are flying, passing through them without knockback.
  - [ ] Flapping Attack: Phantoms hover near high ledges and flap their wings, creating wind that can push players off edges.
- Light Weakness
  - [ ] Phantoms are stunned and immobilized if exposed to strong light sources, twitching in mid-air and becoming weaker to attacks.
  - [ ] At dawn, they flee from the sunlight to shade-covered spaces.
  - [x] Direct contact with sunlight causes them to disintegrate into particles and despawn.
- Insomnia (Status Effect)
  - [x] Prevents affected players from sleeping in a bed.
  - [x] Makes phantoms always aware of the player's location, regardless of distance
